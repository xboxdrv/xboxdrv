.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxboxdrv\fR is a driver for Xbox and Xbox360
gamepads. It works by reading the raw data from the controller
with the userspace library libusb and then passes the
interpreted data to the kernel via uinput. This
allows \fBxboxdrv\fR to provide regular joystick
and event devices, which makes it compatible with all Linux
software.
.PP
Aside from the pure driver, \fBxboxdrv\fR also
includes a rich set of configuration options that allow you to
tweak the abilities of the virtual input devices that xboxdrv
will create. This includes basic button and axis remapping, as
well as more complicated things like mouse and keyboard emulation,
auto-fire and throttle control emulation.
.PP
It is also possible for \fBxboxdrv\fR to read input
data directly from an event device, this allows you to use the
configurability of \fBxboxdrv\fR on regular PC
joysticks and thus lets \fBxboxdrv\fR serve a
similar purpose as \fBjoy2key\fR. See the
option \*(T<\fB\-\-evdev\fR\*(T> below for more information.
.PP
When a \*(T<\fBCOMMAND\fR\*(T> is provided xboxdrv will launch
that application and be running till that application exits.
This is a convenience function to make it easier to use xboxdrv
in wrapper scripts.

List supported devices in \*(T<\fIxpad.c\fR\*(T> style.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-R\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-test\-rumble\fR\*(T>
Pressing LT will move the left rumble motor and pressing
RT will move the right one. Rumble motor strength
depends on how hard you press. This is useful for
testing the rumble motors.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-no\-uinput\fR\*(T>
Do not try to start uinput event dispatching, useful for debugging.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-config\fR\*(T> \fIFILE\fR
Reads configuration information from \fIFILE\fR.
Configurations from file are handling as if they would
be command line options at the position
of \*(T<\fB\-\-config\fR\*(T> \fIFILE\fR.

The syntax
of \fIFILE\fR is
the familiar INI syntax used for many configuration
files. Regular key/value pairs must go into the
[xboxdrv] section. '#' and ';' can be used for comments.
Key names have for most part the same name as command
line options. Command line options that take a list of
input mappings (--ui-buttonmap, --ui-axismap,
--evdev-absmap, ...) can be split of into their own
section for better readability.

The \*(T<\fIexamples/\fR\*(T> directory contains
some example configuration files.

\*(T<\fB\-\-evdev\fR\*(T> \fIDEVICE\fR
Allows you to read input data from a regular event
device. This allows you to
use \fBxboxdrv\fR on regular PC
joysticks. The data that is read from the event device
is converted internally into a XboxMsg object and then
passed through the same configuration pipeline as it
would be for a regular Xbox360 controller. This allows
you to make use of all the regular configurability, but
limits you to the number of axis and buttons that an
Xbox360 controller provides.

As a regular PC joystick will most likely already create
a \*(T<\fI/dev/input/jsX\fR\*(T> device by itself,
you might need to get rid of that so that a game will
properly detect the joystick device created
by \fBxboxdrv\fR. The easiest way to
accomplish that is to simply delete the old joystick and
rename the device that \fBxboxdrv\fR
created to \*(T<\fI/dev/input/js0\fR\*(T>. When you
use udev, this operation should be harmless and
automatically reverse itself when you remove the
controller and plug it back in or when you reboot the
computer.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-evdev\-debug\fR\*(T>
The evdev event handler will print all received events
to stdout, this makes it easy to see which events a
given controller sends.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-evdev\-no\-grab\fR\*(T>
By default the evdev driver will grab the device, thus
making it impossible for other applications to receive
events from that device. This is done to avoid confusing
applications, as otherwise an app would receive every
event twice, once from the original device and once from
the virtual xboxdrv one. In some cases this behaviour is
undesired, such when mapping only an other wise
unhandled subset of keys of an device, i.e. mapping the
multimedia keys on a keyboard, so this option turns the
grab off.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-evdev\-absmap\fR\*(T> \fIABSMAP,...\fR
.nf
\*(T<ABSMAP = EVDEV_ABS [ "+", "\-" ] "=" XBOXAXIS ;\*(T>
.fi

Sets how evdev events are mapped to Xbox axis
events. An example configuration would look like this:

.nf
\*(T<\-\-evdev\-absmap ABS_X=x1,ABS_Y=y1,ABS_RZ=x2,ABS_THROTTLE=y2,ABS_HAT0X=dpad_x,ABS_HAT0Y=dpad_y\*(T>
.fi

\fBxboxdrv\fR will output on startup a full
list of event names that the given event device
supports and that can be used in place of \fIEVDEV_ABS\fR.

It is also possible to map half-axis with a command like:

.nf
\*(T<\-\-evdev\-absmap ABS_Y+=LT,ABS_Y\-=RT\*(T>
.fi

This will map the upward movement of the Y axis to the
left trigger and the downward movement to the right
trigger. 
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-evdev\-keymap\fR\*(T> \fIKEYMAP\fR
Sets how evdev events are mapped to Xbox controller
events. An example configuration would look like this:

.nf
\*(T<\-\-evdev\-keymap BTN_TRIGGER=a,BTN_THUMB=b,BTN_THUMB2=x\*(T>
.fi

\fBxboxdrv\fR will output on start a full
list of event names that the given event device
supports.
.SS "STATUS OPTIONS"

.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-r\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-rumble\fR\*(T> \fIL,R\fR
Set the speed for both rumble motors. Values from 0 to 255 are accepted, the default is 0,0.
.SS "CONFIGURATION OPTIONS"
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-deadzone \fR\*(T>\fINUM\fR
The deadzone is the area at which the sticks do not report any
events. The default is zero, which gives the best sensitifity but
might also cause trouble in some games in that the character or camera
might move without moving the stick. To fix this one has to set the
value to something higher:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-deadzone 4000\*(T>
.fi

A value of 4000 works quite well for most games.

You can also give the deadzone in percentage:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-deadzone 15%\*(T>
.fi
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-deadzone\-trigger \fR\*(T>\fINUM\fR
The left and right trigger have a separate deadzone value which can be
specified with:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-deadzone\-trigger 15%  \*(T>
.fi
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-trigger\-as\-button\fR\*(T>
LT and RT send button instead of axis events
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-trigger\-as\-zaxis\fR\*(T>
Combine LT and RT to form a zaxis instead
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-dpad\-as\-button\fR\*(T>
The DPad sends button instead of axis events.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-dpad\-only\fR\*(T>
Both sticks are ignored, only the DPad sends out axis
events. Useful for games that might get confused by
additional analog axis. Combining this option
with \*(T<\fB\-\-trigger\-as\-button\fR\*(T> is recommend
in most situations.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-b, \-\-buttonmap BUTTON=BUTTON,...\fR\*(T>
Button remapping is available via the \*(T<\fB\-\-buttonmap\fR\*(T> option. If you want
to swap button A and B start with:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-buttonmap A=B,B=A\*(T>
.fi

If you want all face buttons send out A button events:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-buttonmap B=A,X=A,Y=A\*(T>
.fi

Possible button names are (aliases are in parenthesis):

.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-axismap\fR\*(T> \fIAXIS=MAPPING,...\fR
Axis remapping is available via --axismap and works the same as button
mapping. In addition you can supply a sign to indicate that an axis
should be inverted. So if you want to invert the y1 axis start with:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-axismap \-Y1=Y1\*(T>
.fi

If you want to swap the left and right stick start with:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-axismap X2=X1,Y2=Y1,X1=X2,Y1=Y2\*(T>
.fi

Possible axis names are: x1, y1, x2, y2, lt, rt

Swaping lt or rt with x1, y1, x2, y2 will not work properly, since
their range is different.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap\fR\*(T> \fIUIBUTTONSPEC,...\fR
.nf
\*(T<UIBUTTONSPEC = XBOXBUTTON [ "+" XBOXBUTTON ] [ "^" FILTER ] ... "=" ( RELSPEC | BTNSPEC | EXECSPEC ) ;
RELSPEC      = [ DEVICEID "\-" ] "REL_" [ ":" [ VALUE ] [ ":" REPEAT ] ] ;
BTNSPEC      = [ DEVICEID "\-" ] ( ( "BTN_" NAME ) | ( "KEY_" NAME ) ) { "+" BTNSPEC } ;
EXECSPEC     = PROGRAM { ":" ARGUMENT } ;
XBOXBUTTON   = "a" | "b" | "x" | "y" | "lb" | "rb" | "lt" | "rt" | 
               "tl" | "tr" | "start" | "select" | "back" | "guide" | "black" | "white" ;
FILTER       = "toggle" | "invert" | "autofire" [ ":" RATE ] [ ":" DELAY ] | log [ ":" STRING ] ;
NAME         = STRING ;
VALUE        = NUMBER ;
REPEAT       = NUMBER ;
DEVICEID     = NUMBER ;\*(T>
.fi

Allows you to change the event code that is send to the
kernel for buttons. The usage is similar to the normal button
mapping, except that the right hand side is an event name from
\*(T<\fI/usr/include/linux/input.h\fR\*(T>. You can
use all \fBKEY_\fR or \fBBTN_\fR 
codes for \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap\fR\*(T>.

If the right hand side is left empty all the supplied
filters will be added to the already existing button
binding instead of a new one.

Aside from the named keys, you can also give the input
code directly as number via the
syntax \fBKEY_#\fINUM\fB\fR.

Instead of the low level \fBKEY_\fR names,
which represent keycodes, you can also use the higher
level X11 keysyms \fBXK_\fR, the keysyms have
the advantage that they map directly to the key you
expect, while a \fBKEY_\fR name gets mungled
by the X11 keymap and will often not report what you
expect in case you use a keymap that is different then
your keyboard (i.e. dvorak on a qwerty keyboard).

A full list of X11 keysyms is available at
\*(T<\fI/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h\fR\*(T>, note that you can only use those that
are reachable by your current keymap. Keysyms that are reachable via
multiple keycodes might break the mapping from keysym to evdev code.

For joystick buttons there is in addition to the \fBBTN_JOYSTICK\fR, \fBBTN_X\fR,
etc. macros the special name \fBJS_$NUM\fR, which sets the given button to
the $NUMS joystick button, i.e.:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-ui\-clear \-\-ui\-buttonmap A=JS_0,B=JS_1\*(T>
.fi

Note that this will only work if no other joystick
button ids are in the way.

You can also map a button to a \fBREL_\fR
event. In that case you can supply additional paramaters in the form of:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-ui\-buttonmap X=REL_???:VALUE:REPEAT\*(T>
.fi

\fIVALUE\fR gives the value of the event (default: 10)

\fIREPEAT\fR
gives the number of milisecond to pass before the event
is fired again (default: 5)

The special 'void' event allows you to clear any
existing bindings for a given button, which can be
useful in cases when a game only supports a limited
number of buttons.

You can also prepend a device_id to the UIBUTTONSPEC
which allows you to create multiple uinput devices. By
default 'auto' is assumed as device_id which
automatically try to do the right thing, sending
keyboard events to a keyboard device and mouse events to
a mouse device. Other possible values are 'mouse' and
\&'keyboard'. A device_id of '0' refers to the first
joystick device, values larger then 0 to the second,
third, etc. 

Note that the 'mouse' and 'keyboard' device_id names do
not give you a mouse or keyboard device, these are just
symbolic names for the devices into which xboxdrv will
sort events that look like a mouse or keyboard
event. The final determination of which device gets
handled as what will be done by the Kernel or Xorg
depending on what events a device provides.

An example configuration makeing use of device_id would look like this:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \-s \e
  \-\-ui\-clear \e
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap A=0\-JS_0,B=0\-JS_1 \-\-ui\-axismap X2=1\-ABS_X,Y2=1\-ABS_Y
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap X=1\-JS_0,Y=1\-JS_1 \-\-ui\-axismap X2=1\-ABS_X,Y2=1\-ABS_Y\*(T>
.fi

In this example the left stick creates a joystick device
and the right stick creates a separate joystick device.

Instead of giving just a single button, it is also
possible to give two buttons
to \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap\fR\*(T> to allow shifting:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \-s \e
  \-\-ui\-clear \e
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap A=JS_0,B=JS_1,LB+A=JS_2,LB+B=JS_3\*(T>
.fi

In this example LB acts as shift button, if A is pressed
without LB it will send out a JS_0 event, but if LB is
pressed it will send a JS_2 event instead. This allows
you to multiply the number of available buttons on the
controller.

See the section KEYBOARD EMULATION below on how to
resolve issues with Xorg not detecting the virtual
keyboard that xboxdrv creates.

You can also apply filters to button events:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \-s \e
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap A^toggle=JS_0\*(T>
.fi

Hold Button

You can send different events depending on how long a
button was pressed by:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \e
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap A=JS_0:JS_1:500\*(T>
.fi

This will send JS_0 events when the button is pressed
and switch to JS_1 events when the button was hold for
500 miliseconds.

Exec Button

You can bind a button to an application, so that the
application will be launched when the button was
pressed:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \e
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap A=exec:/home/juser/local/bin/screenshot.sh\*(T>
.fi

Macro Button

A button can be bound to a macros via:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \e
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap A=macro:/home/juser/.xboxdrv/somefile.macro\*(T>
.fi

The \*(T<\fI.macro\fR\*(T> file has the form of:

.nf
\*(T<
send KEY_LEFTSHIFT 1
wait 500
send KEY_LEFTSHIFT 0\*(T>
.fi

All abs, rel and key events can be send from a macro file.

Toggle Filter

The toggle filter will turn the button into a toggle
button, clicking the button will set it to pressed state
and pressing it again will unpress it. Useful for games
where you might want to permanently run or duck without
holding the button pressed.

Invert Filter

The invert filter will keep the button in pressed state
when it is not pressed and in unpressed state when it is
pressed.

Autofire Filter

The autofire filter allows to repeatatly send button
press events when the button is held down. It takes two
optional parameters:

\fIRATE\fR is the number of
miliseconds between button press events.

\fIDELAY\fR the amount of
miliseconds till the autofire will start, before that
delay the button will act as normal.

Log Filter

The log filter will output everything to stdout that
goes through it to, this is useful for debugging the
filter. A \fISTRING\fR can be
provided as parameter that will be outputed before the
event.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-axismap\fR\*(T> \fIUIAXISSPEC,...\fR

.fi

Similar to \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap\fR\*(T> this option
allows you to change the event code that is send to the
kernel for axes. The events that are available are the
same as for \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap\fR\*(T>.

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-ui\-axismap X1=REL_???:VALUE:REPEAT\*(T>
.fi

\fIVALUE\fR gives the maximum value of the event (default: 10)

\fIREPEAT\fR
gives the number of milisecond to pass before the event
is fired again (default: 5)

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-ui\-axismap X1=KEY_UP:KEY_DOWN:THRESHOLD\*(T>
.fi

\fIKEY_UP\fR gives the keycode to be send when the axis is moved up

\fIKEY_DOWN\fR gives the keycode to be send when the axis is moved down

\fITHRESHOLD\fR gives the threshold that triggers the sending of an event

Just like \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap\fR\*(T>, you can
also use shift keys in place of the XBOXAXIS:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-ui\-axismap X1=ABS_X,LB+X1=ABS_RX\*(T>
.fi

This allows you to send ABS_X events normally and ABS_RX
events when the LB button is held down.

Deadzone filter applies a deadzone to the current axis.
If only \fIMIN\fR is provided, the
parameter will be interpreted
as \fI-MIN:MIN:1\fR. If the
argument is 1, smooth filtering will be applied so that
the end of the deadzone is 0. Setting the argument to 0
will apply a simple cut-off filter, where all events
smaller then the threshold are ignored.

Relative Axis Filter

See \*(T<\fB\-\-relative\-axis\fR\*(T>.

Response Curve Filter

The response curve filter allows you to completely
change the way an axis reacts. The filter takes a list
of \fIVALUES\fR that are then
linearly interpolated and spread across the full range
of the axis. An example would look like this:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \e
 \-\-ui\-axismap x1^resp:\-32768:\-4000:0:4000:32767=\*(T>
.fi

Here the X1 axis is manipulated so that it will have a
lower sensitivity in the center and a higher one on the
outside.

Log Filter

The log filter will output everything to stdout that
goes through it to, this is useful for debugging the
filter. A \fISTRING\fR can be
provided as parameter that will be outputed before the
event.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-alt\-config\fR\*(T> \fIFILE\fR
A shortcut for writing \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-new\fR\*(T> \*(T<\fB\-\-config\fR\*(T> \fIFILE\fR.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-clear\fR\*(T>
Removes all uinput mappings and will leave the driver in
a blank state and only map those things you added
yourself. If you only want to get rid of individual
buttons you can use the 'void' event.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-new\fR\*(T>
Allows the creation of an alternative uinput
configuration to which one can toggle at runtime by
pressing the ui-toggle button (defaults to guide).

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \e
    \-\-mouse \e
  \-\-ui\-new 
    \-\-ui\-axismap X1=ABS_X,Y1=ABS_Y \e
    \-\-ui\-buttonmap A=JS_0,B=JS_1\*(T>
.fi

The above configuration would install mouse emulation as
first configuration and a simple joystick emulation as
second configuration. Allowing toggling between mouse
emulation and joystick handling by pressing the guide
button.

Not that \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-new\fR\*(T> is currently limited
to only configurations done
with \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap\fR\*(T>
and \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-axismap\fR\*(T>, autofire, throttle
emulation, deadzones and all other things can currently
not be switched at runtime.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-toggle\fR\*(T> \fIXBOXBTN\fR
Sets the button that will be used to toggle between
different uinput configurations.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-guitar\fR\*(T>
Sets a predefined button and axis mapping for use with
guitar controllers. This mainly gets rid of a few
unnecesary buttons and axis not used by a guitar
controller.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-m, \-\-mouse\fR\*(T>
Lets the controller act as a mouse. It is indendical to:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \e
  \-\-dpad\-as\-button
  \-\-deadzone 4000
  \-\-trigger\-as\-zaxis
  \-\-axismap "\-y2=y2,\-trigger=trigger"
  \-\-ui\-axismap "x1=REL_X:15:20,y1=REL_Y:15:20,y2=REL_WHEEL:5:100,x2=REL_HWHEEL:5:100,trigger=REL_WHEEL:5:100"
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap "a=BTN_LEFT,b=BTN_RIGHT,x=BTN_MIDDLE,y=KEY_ENTER,rb=KEY_PAGEDOWN,lb=KEY_PAGEUP,"
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap "dl=KEY_LEFT,dr=KEY_RIGHT,du=KEY_UP,dd=KEY_DOWN,"
  \-\-ui\-buttonmap "start=KEY_FORWARD,back=KEY_BACK,guide=KEY_ESC,tl=void,tr=void"\*(T>
.fi

You can customize it by the usual means, just make sure
that \*(T<\fB\-\-mouse\fR\*(T> comes before you
customization options on the command line.

Note that if you have your mouse buttons switched you must
adjust the above to match your mouse configuration or the
button events will come out wrong.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-name DEVNAME\fR\*(T>
Changes the descriptive name the device will have
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-square\-axis\fR\*(T>
The Xbox360 gamepad, as most other current day gamepads,
features a circular movement range, which restricts the
movement so that the distance to the center never gets
beyond 1. This means that when you have the controller
at the top/left the value reported is (0.7, 0.7)
(i.e. length 1, angle 45) instead of (1,1). This
behaviour is different then most classic PC joysticks,
which had a square range and would report (1,1) when
hold in the top/left corner.

Some old games (i.e. mostly DOS stuff) require a
square movement range and will not function properly
with the Xbox360 gamepad. Via the
\*(T<\fB\-\-square\-axis\fR\*(T> option you can work around this issue and diagonals will
be reported as (1,1).
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-four\-way\-restrictor\fR\*(T>
The \*(T<\fB\-\-four\-way\-restrictor\fR\*(T> option allows to
limit the movement on both analogsticks to only four
directions (up, down, left, right), the diagonals (up/left,
up/right, down/left, down/right) are filtered out from the
output. This option is useful for games such as Tetris, that
don't need diagonals and where you don't want to accidently
trigger the down-move while trying to do a left/right move.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-dpad\-rotation\fR\*(T> \fIDEGREE\fR
Allows you to rotate the
dpad. \fIDEGREE\fR
must be a multiple of 45. This can be useful in
isometric games where the playfield itself is rotated,
thus a:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \-\-dpad\-rotation 45\*(T>
.fi

Will give you controls that are relative to your
character instead of your viewpoint.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-axis\-sensitivty \fR\*(T>\fIAXIS=SENSITIVITY\fR,...
The sensitive of an axis can be adjusted via --axis-sensitivty:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-axis\-sensitivty X1=\-2.0,Y1=\-2.0\*(T>
.fi

A value of 0 gives you the default linear sensitivity, values larger
then 0 will give you heigher sensitivity, while values smaller then 0
will give you lower sensitivity.

Sensitivity works by applying:

.nf
\*(T<t = 2 ** sensitivity;
pos = (1.0f \- (1.0f \- pos) ** t) ** (1 / t);\*(T>
.fi

To the value of the axis, thus both the min and max position will
always stay the same, only the values inbetween change.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-relative\-axis AXIS=NUM,...\fR\*(T>
The function \*(T<\fB\-\-relative\-axis\fR\*(T> allows you
to change the behaviour of an axis so that your movement
of it moves its value up or down instead of applying it
directly. This allows you to simulate throttle control
for flightsim games.

Since the axis might be upside down, you might want to use
the \*(T<\fB\-\-axismap\fR\*(T> function to reverse it.

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-relative\-axis y2=64000 \-\-axismap \-y2=y2\*(T>
.fi
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-autofire BUTTON=FREQUENCY\fR\*(T>
Autofire mapping allows you to let a button automatically fire with a
given frequency in miliseconds:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-autofire A=250\*(T>
.fi

Combining \*(T<\fB\-\-autofire\fR\*(T> with button map allows you to have one button act
as autofire while another one, emitting the same signal, acts normally.

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-autofire B=250 \-\-buttonmap B=A\*(T>
.fi
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-calibration \fR\*(T>\fICALIBRATIONSPEC\fR
If your gamepad for some reason can't reach the maximum value or isn't
centered properly you can fix that via the calibration options:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-calibration X2=\-32768:0:32767\*(T>
.fi

X2 is the axis name and the three values that follow are min, center
and max. Simply insert the values that jstest reports when your axis
is in the respective positions.

You can also use the calibration option if you want to make your
joystick more sensitive. A setting of:

.nf
\*(T<xboxdrv \-\-calibration AXIS=MIN:CENTER:MAX,...\*(T>
.fi

Will cause the joystick device report maximum position when your
stick is only moved half the way.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-axis\-sensitivty \fR\*(T>\fIAXIS=SENSITIVITY\fR,...
The sensitive of an axis can be adjusted via --axis-sensitivty:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-axis\-sensitivty X1=\-2.0,Y1=\-2.0\*(T>
.fi

A value of 0 gives you the default linear sensitivity, values larger
then 0 will give you heigher sensitivity, while values smaller then 0
will give you lower sensitivity.

Sensitivity works by applying:

.nf
\*(T<t = 2 ** sensitivity;
pos = (1.0f \- (1.0f \- pos) ** t) ** (1 / t);\*(T>
.fi

To the value of the axis, thus both the min and max position will
always stay the same, only the values inbetween change.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-force\-feedback\fR\*(T>
Enables the standard kernel force feedback interface. It
is disabled by default as it causes trouble with some
applications running in Wine.

Since the Xbox360 controller supports just rumble not full force
feedback, xboxdrv tries to emulate other effects. This emulation
hasn't been tested much and might not always work as expected. Bug
reports and test cases are welcome.

Note that you must close the application that is using force feedback
always before you close the xboxdrv driver, else you might end up with
a hanging non-interruptable xboxdrv process that will require a reboot
to get rid of.
.TP 
\*(T<\fB\-\-rumble\-gain\fR\*(T> \fIAMOUNT\fR
You can change the rumble strength via:

.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-rumble\-gain 50%\*(T>
.fi

Values larger then 100% are possible as well.
.SH "RUNNING XBOXDRV"
Plug in your Xbox360 gamepad and then unload the xpad driver via:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ rmmod xpad\*(T>
.fi
.PP
If you want to permanently unload it add the following line to
\*(T<\fI/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf\fR\*(T>:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<blacklist xpad\*(T>
.fi
.PP
Next you have to load the uinput kernel module which allows userspace
programms to create input devices and the joydev module which gives
you the \*(T<\fI/dev/input/jsX\fR\*(T> device:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ modprobe uinput
$ modprobe joydev\*(T>
.fi
.PP
You also have to make sure that you have access rights to
/dev/input/uinput, either add yourself to the appropriate group,
adjust the permissions or run xboxdrv as root.
.PP
Once ensured that xpad is out of the way and everything is in place
start the userspace driver with:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv\*(T>
.fi
.PP
Or in case you don't have the neccesary rights (being in group root
should often be enough) start the driver as root via:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ sudo xboxdrv\*(T>
.fi
.PP
This will create /dev/input/js0 and allow you to access the gamepad
from any game. To exit the driver press Ctrl-c. 
If you have multiple wired controllers you need to start multiple instances
of the xboxdrv driver and append the -i argument like this:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-i 1\*(T>
.fi
.PP
If you have multiple wireless controller you need to start multiple
instances of the xboxdrv driver and append the --wid argument like
this:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-wid 1\*(T>
.fi
.PP
You have to sync the wireless controller as usual.
.PP
This will then use the second detected controller, see to see which id
your controller has:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-list\-controller\*(T>
.fi
.PP
When everything works as expected it is recomment that you run xboxdrv
with the silent option:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-silent\*(T>
.fi
.PP
This will suppress the logging of events to the console and will
gurantee that no uneccesarry CPU cycles are wasted.
.PP
If you want to abuse the led or rumble of the gamepad for notification
in scripts you can do see via:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-led 10 \-\-rumble 30,30 \-\-quit\*(T>
.fi
.PP
This will cause a mild rumble and the led to rotate, you can stop it
again via, which also happens to be the command you can use to stop
your Xbox360 controller from blinking:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-\-led 0 \-\-rumble 0,0 \-\-quit\*(T>
.fi
.PP
For rumble to work make sure you have connected the
controller to a USB port that has enough power, an unpowered USB
hub might not work.
.SH TESTING
Knowing how to test a xboxdrv configuration is absolutely crucial in
understanding what is wrong in a given setup. Testing the
configuration in a game is most often not helpful, since you won't see
the true cause beyond endless layers of abstraction between you and
the actual events. Luckily there are a few tools you can use to test,
all of these are command line based and it is recomment that you get
familar with them when you want to do any more complex configuration.
.SS EVTEST
evtest lets you read raw input events from \*(T<\fI/dev/input/eventX\fR\*(T>. The
event devices are the very core of all event handling, things like the
joystick devices are derived from the event device, so if you want to
fix some issue on the joystick device, you have to fix the event
device.
.PP
evtest is available in the tools/ directory, you might also find it in
your distribution.
.SS JSTEST
jstest lets you read the output out of a joystick event device (/dev/input/js0).
.PP
jstest is available in the tools/ directory or as part of your
distribution.
.SS SDL-JSTEST
sdl-jstest lets you see events as games using SDL see them. This is
very important when you want to set and test the SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK
environment variables.
.PP
Currently available via:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ svn co svn://svn.berlios.de/windstille/trunk/sdl\-jstest\*(T>
.fi
.SS XEV
xev lets you see the events that Xorg sees. Note however that you
might not see all events, since some will be grapped by your Window
manager before they reach xev, this is normal.
.PP
xev is part of every Linux distribution, on Ubuntu its available via:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ apt\-get install x11\-utils\*(T>
.fi
.SS JSCALC
Do not use this tool, for current day joysticks it doesn't do
anything useful, so don't touch it, it won't fix your problems.
.SS MOUSE
No tools for testing the output on /dev/input/mouseX are known.
.SS NOTE
If the tools provide no output at all, this might not be due to a
wrong configuration, but due to Xorg grabbing your event device and
locking it, see Xorg section for possible fixes.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS "KEYBOARD EMULATION"
The following configuration works for games that are
played with keyboard, like Flash games or games that don't
support a joystick. You might have to adjust the keybindings
to fit the game:
.PP
.nf

.SS "PRINCE OF PERSIA OR TOMB RAIDER ANNIVERSARY IN WINE "
Start \fBxboxdrv\fR with:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-trigger\-as\-button \-s \*(T>
.fi
.PP
The triggers are not regonized in these games when they
are analog, so we have to handle them as buttons.
.SS "FIGHTING GAMES WITH DATEL ARCADE PRO JOYSTICK:"
The left and right trigger get turned into digital buttons. All axis
except the dpad are ignored. RB and RT are mapped to act as if buttons
1,2 and 3 are pressed simultaniously (useful for some special
attacks). Instead of using the native button names, the
1,2,3,... aliases are used, which makes things easier to edit:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \-\-dpad\-only \e
  \-\-trigger\-as\-button  \e
  \-\-buttonmap lb=1,x=2,y=3,lt=4,a=5,b=6,rb=1,rb=2,rb=3,rt=4,rt=5,rt=6\*(T>

.PP
Your right analog stick will act as trottle control, the trigger as
rudder.
.SS SAUERBRATEN

.SS "USING MOUSE EMULATION AND JOYSTICK AT THE SAME TIME"
To use mouse emulation and joystick at the same time you have
to register two uinput configuration with xboxdrv, this works
via:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ xboxdrv \e
  \-\-ui\-new \-\-mouse
\*(T>.fi
.PP
The \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-new\fR\*(T> option will open up a second
configuration and all configuration options on the right side
of it will go there, while everything on the left side of it
will go into the first configuration. Toggling between the
configurations works with the guide button, you can have as
many configuratios as you want.
.SH "SDL NOTES"
To let SDL know which axis act as a hat and which act as normal axis
you have to set an environment variable:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<
$ SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK="'Xbox Gamepad (userspace driver)' 6 1 0"
$ export SDL_LINUX_JOYSTICK\*(T>
.fi
.PP
You might also need in addition use this (depends on the way SDL was compiled):
.PP
.nf
\*(T<
$ SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE="/dev/input/js0"
$ export SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE\*(T>
.fi
.PP
This will let the DPad act as Hat in SDL based application. For
many games the driver will work without this, but especially in
Dosbox this variable is very important.
.PP
If you use options in xboxdrv that change the number of axis you
have to adjust the variable accordingly, see:

.SS "\(dqUNKNOWN DATA: BYTES: 3 DATA: ...\(dq"
This means that your controller is sending data that isn't understood
by the driver. If your controller still works, you can just ignore it,
the Xbox360 controller seems to send out useless data every now and
then. If your controller does not work and you get plenty of those

Along with all the "Unknown data" lines you get. 
.SS "PROGRAM STARTS AND THEN JUST DOES NOTHING"
This is what the program is supposed to do. After you started it, it
will give you basically two devices, a new /dev/input/eventX and a
/dev/input/jsX. You can access and test your controller with jstest
and evtest applications (available from your distribution or in the

\*(T<\fI/etc/X11/xorg.conf\fR\*(T>:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<Section "ServerFlags"
  Option "AutoAddDevices" "False"
EndSection\*(T>
.fi
.PP
Note that without auto detection you will have to manually configure
all your mice and keyboards or your Xorg Server won't start up
properly. So unless you are already familiar with editing Xorg you
better avoid this workaround. Workaround 3) has basically the same
effect, except that auto detection only gets disabled for the single
device it is causing problems.
.SH "WACOM TROUBLE"
In recent kernels a Wacom graphic tablet creates a joystick device, so
xboxdrv or any other real joysticks ends up as \*(T<\fI/dev/input/js1\fR\*(T> instead
of \*(T<\fI/dev/input/js0\fR\*(T>. In many games this causes the joystick to not
function any more.
.PP
A temporary workaround for this is to simply delete the joystick
device js0 and replace it with a symbolic link js1 via:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<$ sudo ln \-sf /dev/input/js1 /dev/input/js0\*(T>
.fi
.PP
This workaround will only last till the next reboot, since the device
names are dynamically created, but for the time being there doesn't
seem to any other way to easily work around this issue. 
.SH "UINPUT TROUBLE"
On Ubuntu 9.04 the permissions of the uinput device have changed to
0640, meaning only root has access to the device. To change this back
so that users in the group root have access the device and in turn can
run xboxdrv without sudo you have to create a file called:
.PP
\*(T<\fI/etc/udev/rules.d/55\-permissions\-uinput.rules\fR\*(T>
.PP
With the content:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="root"\*(T>
.fi
.SH "WINE TROUBLE"
When using the Xbox360 gamepad in Wine it is not specially handled as
Xbox360 gamepad, this means games will not display the proper button
labels, but just numbers (i.e. 'Btn1' instead of 'A' for
example). Aside from that it should work fine.
.PP
XInput support (the DirectInput replacment, not the Xorg xinput)
is as of August 2010 not implemented in Wine, so games that
require XInput and don't have an DirectInput fallback will not
work with a Xbox360 controller, unofficial patches however do exist.
.SH "FORCE FEEDBACK PROGRAMMING"

.PP
\fBfftest\fR is an application you can use to test the force feedback
interface.
.PP
Force feedback is disabed by default since it seems to causes trouble
in certain application, namely "Tomb Raider: Legend" when run in Wine
it crashes at startup when rumble is enabled, while it works perfectly
normal when rumble is disabled.
.PP
"Tomb Raider: Anniversary" running in Wine seems to work together with
xboxdrv and rumble, but hasn't been intensivly tested.
.SH "WRITING START-UP SCRIPTS FOR GAMES"
When you want configurability and automatic launching, it is recomment
that you write little startup scripts for your games, such as this:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<#!/bin/sh

# Start xboxdrv and remember its PID in the variable XBOXPID
xboxdrv \-\-trigger\-as\-button \-s &amp;
XBOXPID=$!

# Give xboxdrv a second to startup and create the device
sleep 1

# Launch your favorite game
your_favorite_game

# Kill xboxdrv and wait for it to finish
kill $XBOXPID
wait $XBOXPID

# EOF #\*(T>
.fi
.PP
That way you can individually configure every game and not
have to worry about launching xboxdrv manually.
.SH BUGS
X11 keysyms might not work correctly in \*(T<\fB\-\-ui\-buttonmap a=XK_Foobar\fR\*(T>
when Foobar is mapped to multiple keycodes in the keymap. 
.PP
Workaround: Use \fBKEY_\fR instead or cleanup your keymap
.PP
Force feedback support is brittle, if you Ctrl-c the driver in the
wrong moment you will end up with a dead uninterruptable process and
basically have to reboot. This looks like it might be a kernel issue
and not a xboxdrv one.
.PP
Workaround: Kill the app that uses xboxdrv before xboxdrv itself.
