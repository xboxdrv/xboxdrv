Stuff to do before 0.7.4 release:
=================================

* add --controller 4 or --controller-count 4 or something like that

* add special LED status set switches the LED with the given config

  if (opts.priority == Options::kPriorityRealtime)
  {
    // try to set realtime priority when root, as user there doesn't
    // seem to be a way to increase the priority
    if (geteuid() != 0)
    {
      log_error("realtime priority scheduling requires running as root");
    }
    else
    {
      log_info("enabling realtime priority scheduling");
      pthread_t tid = static_cast<pthread_t>(m_thread->native_handle());
  
      int ret;
      int policy;
      struct sched_param param;
      memset(&param, 0, sizeof(struct sched_param));

      policy = SCHED_RR;
      param.sched_priority = sched_get_priority_max(policy);

      // we don't try SCHED_OTHER for users as min and max priority is
      // 0 for that, thus we can't change anything with that

      if ((ret = pthread_setschedparam(tid, policy, &param)) != 0)
      {
        log_error("pthread_setschedparam() failed: " << ret);
      }
    }
  }

* export build-in config files, both as text and as directory, so that users can browse them

* deadzone:MIN:MAX:SMOOTH is broken (fixed)

* deadzone filter documentation is wrong

* d-bus requires X11?! -> try system bus when running as root

Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed." failed to open connection to bus: /bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.

* add named output variables to chain filters and modifiers?!

== Daemon ==

* check how daemon reacts on suspend
  - suspending the computer leads to LIBUSB_ERROR_IO, unplugging the
    controller leads to LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER
    -> couldn't be replicated, both give LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER
  - errno is set to EBUSY
  - the device handle can't be reused, device has to be reallocated
  - integrate this with the "keep backlog of devices currently in use"

* do something with stdout/stderr when its run in --detach mode

== Other ==

* button presses are lost even with "--priority realtime" for the wireless controller

  -> xboxdrv isn't running under realtime priority, only its subthreads, fix that
  -> figure out how USBReadThread reacts to the device being closed
     -> USBReadThread doesn't react at all, it becomes stuck in the last call

* use static X11 keysym map to do the string translation?

* split src/axis_event.hpp and src/button_event.hpp

* mouse emulation is very jaggy (try painting in Gimp), caused by
  REL_X and REL_Y being send independently, while they should be
  synced up, this is a side-effect of the deadzone, without deadzone,
  no jaggies

  -> UInput::send_rel_repetitive() needs to syncronize all REL events
     with the same repeat interval whenever a new event comes in

     send_val = value * time_count / repeat;
     time_count = 0;

  -> add a repeat timeout 0  that sends on each update

  -> should be use special value '-1' or repurpose '0'?

  -> do we need more rel types? rel-once? or can repeat values be
     abused?
     
     repeat: 0 - always repeat, -1, never repeat, NUM - repeat every NUM msec

  -> add rel-repeat:{repeat} type that repeats more often the more the
     stick is pressed, to give better scroll wheel emulation

* add "key-once" or something like that, that only clicks a key
  without keeping it pressed

* documentation needs to be improved

* --ui-axismap LT=KEY_A:KEY_B:1 

Here KEY_B is the key you want to send and KEY_A is a random other key
that you don't need. It's a hack as mapping both to KEY_B seems to
cause some trouble with automatic key repeat for some reason. Note
that you must not combine this with --trigger-as-zaxis as that will
disable LT and RT

* add a "click" filter or something like that, that causes a button to only be clicked, not hold

== Documentation ==

* X11 will convert a REL_WHEEL value of 1 into a single click (press
  and release) of button 4, values of 3 would result in three clicks,
  etc. REL_HWEEL will be button 6 and 7, add that to documentation somewhere

== Bugs ==
     
* multiple ControllerThread lead to UInput::update() being called
  multiple times, as UInputMessageProcessor does call the update()
  which is wrong

* glib/D-Bus causes crash/exit when USBController::get_name() returns an invalid unicode string?!

* LED isn't set proper when wireless controllers wake up from power-down


== Unsolved/WontFix ==

* after every thread cleanup, do an enumeration over all USB devices,
  find those not currently used by a Slot and recreate them, this
  should fix resume issues, this would also fix the issue with
  ignoring controllers when all slots are full

  -> bad idea, as it would let unused controllers slip into the free
     slots, could lead to unexpected behaviour

  -> maybe as D-Bus interface?

* allow multiple controllers in non-daemon mode
  -> not a good idea, complicates stuff and duplicates code

* remember controllers that couldn't be used when all slots where full
  and use them when a slot got free -> discard, bad idea, as it
  results in confusing behaviour

* daemon on regular xboxdrv have different controller orderings 

  -> hard to avoid, as wireless controllers are only picked up when
     active, which they always become later then the wired ones, which
     are active by default)

* add libusb-0.1 support back (maybe only in 0.7.4)
  -> no, need a full switch

* move sigint/sigterm handling out of main.cpp and into xboxdrv_daemon.cpp (needs to use gmain_quit())

* BTN_A@joystick.1 doesn't work for a single joystick, why? (joystick isn't id=0, why?)

* improve output on which uinput devices are created (even with udev
  there doesn't seem to be a bullet proof way to detect what gets
  created)

  -> insert "guess code" before the uinput create call and just pretent thats bullet proof
  -> figure out how exactly device names are choosen (first free or
     are there other means? need to take special axes/buttons into account)


== Daemon ==

* improve output in daemon mode, when --quiet is not given print the
  number of allocated controller slots

* get rid of all std::cout stuff when using detached daemon, redirect
  log output to a file, syslog or somewhere else: 

  --silent:  stops event output
  --quiet:   stops all stdout output (automatically used when --detach is given, except for errors)
  --verbose: print info level log output
  --debug:   print debug level log output


== D-Bus ==

* interface for next release:

  Daemon/GetControllerSlotCount -> INT // do we need those or can
  Daemon/GetControllerCount -> INT     // directories be browsed?

== Other ==

* document that Xbox360 wireless controller shuts down at 15min

* give proper exit code when no controller is found

* sort options a bit more between global ones, slot local ones and
  config local ones

* in INI files should allow:

  [xboxdrv]
  ui-buttonmap = A=BTN_A,B=BTN_B,...

  - in general cleanup config handling, turn almost everything into
    proper functions and use the same functions for both cmdline and ini

* allow setting a --default-name from which all other controller names
  are derived 
   -> already there in the form of auto.auto? 
     -> No, as those don't derive the name, but set a fixed one

* allow swap/assign of controller to slots via dbus

* do modifier/filter dump when --verbose is given, make verbose
  overall more useful

* make more use of percentance values (in deadzone filter for example)

* couldn't convert 'XK_Page_Up' to enum, not a member of X11Keysym
  currenty code can't handle multple names for a single key

* add a fun modifier that counts button presses and other useless stuff

  - count button presses (done)
  - count time a button is held down, both in min:sec and percent
  - count distance an axis travels
  - allow access/reset via dbus

  * document them, ignore axis and button time for now

* look at Joy2key for better mouse support (mouse acceleration), see Dustin Moline mails
  * timeout makes a huge difference, real MarbleMouse Trackball send around every 10msec
  * need to deal with rounding errors to allow small movements

* add --ui-buttonmap A=KEY_A:KEY_B:1000:1 

  the last 0/1 parameter tells if it should do:

   - 0: send on release
   - 1: always send when pressed

  different games might require different behaviours for the
  hold-button, so it should be an user option

* add double shift buttons: L+R+start

* add execv: that takes arguments in ARG0:ARG1,... style

* add system: that takes arguments "ARG0 ARG1 ..." style

* add [controller0/config0] support for ControllerOptions

* add [controller0] support for ControllerSlotOptions

* write relaxation modifier/filter

* make extra-event creation a bit more clever, i.e. only create BTN_A
  when needed, not when another button is present that can be used to
  identify the device as joystick, also document exactly which
  buttons/axis combinations are valid.

* allow something like:

  void = BTN_A

  to create empty events on uinput

Other Stuff
===========

* remove uinput.send_rel_repetitive() replace with just EventHandler::update()

  -> might not be needed, send_rel_repetitive() is kind of convenient  

  -> send_rel_repetitive() doesn't work with multi-axis REL events (mouse emulation)

* boost::lexical_cast<> error messages are useless, make some better ones

Daemon Match Rules
==================

* add match rule for wireless id -> not really useful as that id is
  more or less random

* add --exclude, --exclude-group as ControllerMatchRules

* XboxdrvThread or XboxGenericController must hold information on
  their: bus:dev, vendor:product and other potentially useful
  information, match rule must match against controller, not
  udev_device
   -> doesn't work, as we don't have a controller at that point
   -> match against abstract ControllerInfo object?
   -> get_busnum()
   -> get_devnum()

   -> figure out potential matches early and save the valid slots?
      -> ugly but could work

* --match again sysname could make sense, seems somewhat constant:
  "5-2" Xbox1 controller results in "5-2.1", due to being really two
  devices, would help to now how exactly those are formed

* extend usbid match rule to bcd device


Stuff to do before 0.7.3 release:
=================================

* turn EnumBox into singleton

* allow EnumBox to have multiple names per values per key

* allow --modifier help, --ui-buttonmap X2^help

* move XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN behind XBOX_BTN_MAX (or make it -1), so
  iteration can start from 0 instead of 1, also fix incorrect
  iterations all over the place -> doesn't work as some code uses
  XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN as 'no button is pressed'

* document significant patches in AUTHORS

      2     Added latest version of runxboxdrv from Michael Rans <rans@email.com>
      1     Added trigger deadzone patch from Jan Henning Thorsen <git@flodhest.net> with a few changes
      1     Applied daniel åkerud <daniel.akerud@gmail.com>'s SIGTERM patch
      1     Applied low latency patch from daniel åkerud <daniel.akerud@gmail.com>
      1 Author: Aaron Denney <wnoise@ofb.net>
      1     hal daemon from Thomas Debouverie <debouverie_thomas@yahoo.fr>
      1     Implemented --ui-buttonmap A=BTN_A@{device_id} ??!?!?

* need to hide/disable the toggle button from the UIButtonmap
  - maybe implement some full post-parsing option verification to
    check for conflicts and necessary modifications?
  - Options::finish() to do final things?


Stuff to do before 0.7.x release:
=================================

* add Wiimote and PS3 bluetooth support 

* -R, --rumble-test is broken for FirestormDualController (has no analog triggers)

* add ABS support to macros events (need to deal with min/max)

* add support for pairing the controller to the PC (or zero)

  --ps3-pair 00:00:00:00:00:00
  --ps3-pair-with-bluetooth

* get rid of set_button()/get_button(), turn the message objects into full classes

* make chatpad configurable:

  --ui-chatpad a=KEY_A,green+a=SHIFT_X+KEY_B,...

* make sure that XK_??? names work with keys that are
  shifted/mode_switched in the keymap, i.e. send key combination

* can't parse:

 --ui-axismap x2=2-ABS_X,y2=2-ABS_Y

  only this works:

 --ui-axismap x2=abs:2-ABS_X,y2=abs:2-ABS_Y

  implement better guessing

* current deadzone code messes up the diagonals

* shifted axis without default mapping don't work:

  ./xboxdrv --ui-axismap lb+x1^cal:-64000:0:64000

  in those cases the default mapping for the unshifted axis should be used

* add analog emulation for button (i.e. the longer its pressed, the higher the value)

* write UIEvent::from_string()

* basic Dualstrike mouse emulation with absolute position:

 ./xboxdrv-dualstrike \
  --ui-clear \
  --ui-buttonmap rb=key:1-BTN_LEFT,lb=key:1-BTN_RIGHT \
  --ui-axismap x2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_X,y2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_Y \
  --ui-axismap x1=KEY_LEFT:KEY_RIGHT,y1=KEY_DOWN:KEY_UP  -s

* change default axis/button map depending on controller type (tricky as
  type is only really known after the axis/buttonmap as already been
  build):

* remove guide button from default mapping when its an Xbox1 controller

* guitar handling was changed in a4e1003cba0ff925358ce5ed84d2bf9a728e93d6 

* REL_ events could need acceleration support, as mouse emulation is currently kind of imprecise

Stuff to do before 0.7.x release:
=================================

* add extra checks to make sure the evdev buttons and axis given exist
  on the current device when using --evdev

* invert y axis on --evdev

* allow --type to work even when --device-by-id is not given

* axis emulation

  --ui-axisemulation A:B=ABS_X:5

* match by protocol not, just vendor/product, from xpad.c:

/* Xbox 360 has a vendor-specific class, so we cannot match it with only
 * USB_INTERFACE_INFO (also specifically refused by USB subsystem), so we
 * match against vendor id as well. Wired Xbox 360 devices have protocol 1,
 * wireless controllers have protocol 129. */

  --ui-axismap LT=KEY_A:KEY_A:1

Feature
=======

* figure out a way to make userspace force feedback driver not become dead processes

* test TR:Anniversary with max effect 16


fixme:dinput:joy_polldev joystick cannot handle type 21 event (code 0) <- 21 == EV_FF (status report?)

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219655(VS.85).aspx

Later versions:
===============

* The World Tour wireless guitar have 5 buttons and a
  slide. Currently, the slide is mapped to the x axis, but I don't
  know if it allows multiple presses at once. I don't have a Xbox, so
  I don't know if it is allowed at all in the console.

Colour: 	Button: 	Value in X1 (slide):
Green 	A	-27500
Red	B	-12900
Yellow	Y	+7000
Blue	X	+18500
Orange	LB1	+32767
(None)	(None)	-300

* send FF status reports (maybe, is that used by anything?)

* figure out the max values of force feedback effects so that stuff is
  mapped more properly (kind of done, could need verification)

* figure out which devices xorg/hal handles as keyboard and how to
  make it always happen, seems to require two keyboard keys, devices
  with only one aren't registered

* report more precisly what devices got created, include device name (HAL has that information)

* add support for LED messages (can this be used by anything?)


Stuff to do before 0.8.0 release:
