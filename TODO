Pre Release Testing:
====================

* check the version number

VERSION="$(cat VERSION)"
TAG="v${VERSION}"
git tag -s  "${TAG}" -m "xboxdrv ${TAG}" 

# Normal Source
git archive --format=tar --prefix="xboxdrv-linux-${VERSION}/" ${TAG} | bzip2 -c > /tmp/xboxdrv-linux-${VERSION}.tar.bz2

git push --tags


Ubuntu Package:
===============

add libudev, libusb-1.0 to builddependencies

# Ubuntu 10.10

$ cd ../debian/
$ git checkout master
$ git-import-orig -u 0.7.0 ~/projects/xboxdrv/htdocs/xboxdrv-linux-0.7.0.tar.bz2 
$ dch -v "0.7.0-1" "xboxdrv 0.7.0 release"
$ git-buildpackage --git-no-create-orig --git-tag --git-builder="debuild -S"
$ sudo pbuilder --build ../xboxdrv_0.7.0-1.dsc
$ dput my-ppa ../xboxdrv_0.7.0-1_source.changes

# Ubuntu 10.04 (LTS)

$ cd ../debian/
$ git checkout master-lts
$ git merge master
$ dch -b -v "0.7.0-1~lucid1" --distribution lucid "xboxdrv 0.7.0 backport"
$ git-buildpackage --git-no-create-orig --git-debian-branch=master-lts --git-tag --git-builder="debuild -S"
$ sudo pbuilder --build ../xboxdrv_0.7.0-1~lucid1.dsc
$ dput my-ppa ../xboxdrv_0.7.0-1~lucid1_source.changes


Stuff to do before 0.7.0 release:
=================================

* get rid of all std::cout stuff when using detached daemon, redirect
  log output to a file somewhere else: 

  --silent:  stops event output
  --quiet:   stops all stdout output (automatically used when --detach is given)
  --verbose: print info level log output
  --debug:   print debug level log output
  --log-level: only log stuff at LEVEL or below

* figure out a good place to set the LEDs off when Xboxdrv is quit,
  just doing it in the destructor causes trouble, as the usbdev might
  be no longer usable (when controller got unplugged)

* AxisSensitivity filter has overflow issue 

* fix the FIXME's

* need to hide/disable the toggle button from the UIButtonmap
  - maybe implement some full post-parsing option verification to
    check for conflicts and necessary modifications?
  - Options::finish() to do final things?

* move XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN behind XBOX_BTN_MAX, so iteration can start
  from 0 instead of 1, also fix incorrect iterations all over the
  place -> doesn't work as some code uses XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN as 'no
  button is pressed'

Daemon Related Stuff
====================

* improve output on which uinput devices are created

* cleanup device_id, don't manually do (slot<<16) | devid

* might need magic to give device-ids in a slot fashion: 
  from: 1-ABS_X   (second uinput device)
  to:   2.1-ABS_X (third uinput device for the second slot)
   2.mouse-BTN_MIDDLE ?!
   1.-BTN_MIDDLE
   1.auto-BTN_MIDDLE
   auto-BTN_MIDDLE

  change syntax: BTN_MIDDLE@mouse, BTN_MIDDLE@2.mouse

  must make sure it doesn't conflict with anything

List Output
===========

* update docu on force feedback for multi controller

* rename --list-key to --help-key?

* do modifier/filter dump when --verbose is given, make verbose
  overall more useful

* turn EnumBox into singleton

* Keysym2Keycode is currently always constructed at startup, even when
  not used, construct it on demand

* document significant patches in AUTHORS

      2     Added latest version of runxboxdrv from Michael Rans <rans@email.com>
      1     Added trigger deadzone patch from Jan Henning Thorsen <git@flodhest.net> with a few changes
      1     Applied daniel åkerud <daniel.akerud@gmail.com>'s SIGTERM patch
      1     Applied low latency patch from daniel åkerud <daniel.akerud@gmail.com>
      1 Author: Aaron Denney <wnoise@ofb.net>
      1     hal daemon from Thomas Debouverie <debouverie_thomas@yahoo.fr>
      1     Implemented --ui-buttonmap A=BTN_A@{device_id} ??!?!?

Stuff to do before 0.7.1 release:
=================================

* print controller type/name in daemon (little tricky as that is only
  known after opening the USB connection)

* need magic to assign controller to a slot:
 
  what:  match product/vendor-id, match device name
  where: match USB path, match /dev/input/??? path
  when:  just assign them to the next free slot

  --match RULE,...       # match any of the given rules
  --match-group RULE,... # match all of the given rules

  Rules:
  ======
  usbpath=005:003 (implicit vendor/product match)
  usbid=045f:028f
  evdev=/dev/input/event5
  (no rules means it always matches)

  1) search for match
  2) if no match is found search slots without rules

  * matching by usbpath makes very little sense, as the dev argument
    gets incremented with each replug, bus alone might be usable
  
  * match again sysname could make sense, seems somewhat constant: "5-2"
    Xbox1 controller results in "5-2.1", due to being really two devices

* implement --on-connect and --on-disconnect for the daemon
  - maybe have a more general event interface that allows to run stuff
    on configuration changes, controller plug-ins, etc. (notifiy area as example)
  - also supply useful information as argument


Stuff to do before 0.7.x release:
=================================

* -R, --rumble-test is broken for FirestormDualController (has no analog triggers)

* add ABS support to macros (need to deal with min/max)

* Playstation 3 controller support
  - http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixlinux.en.html
  - http://www.motioninjoy.com/

  - figure out what the remaining unknown bits mean:

     data from just pluging the controller in and out a few times
     without much pause inbetween:

     Dualshock3:
     // leaving controller plugged in for a longer time settles to this:

     random guesses: bluetooth id, serial number, calibration data,
     battery status

* add support for pairing the controller to the PC (or zero)

  --ps3-pair 00:00:00:00:00:00
  --ps3-pair-with-bluetooth

* allow named sections in INI files:

  [controller1/modifier]
  [controller1/config1/modifier]
  [controller2/modifier]
  [controller2/modifier]
  [controller3/config1/modifier]
  [controller3/config2/modifier]

* get rid of set_button()/get_button(), turn the message objects into full classes

* document common problems, such as lack of deadzone handling in games

* make chatpad configurable:

  --ui-chatpad a=KEY_A,green+a=SHIFT_X+KEY_B,...

* make sure that XK_??? names work with keys that are
  shifted/mode_switched in the keymap, i.e. send key combination

* can't parse:

 --ui-axismap x2=2-ABS_X,y2=2-ABS_Y

  only this works:

 --ui-axismap x2=abs:2-ABS_X,y2=abs:2-ABS_Y

  implement better guessing

* current deadzone code messes up the diagonals

* shifted axis without default mapping don't work:

  ./xboxdrv --ui-axismap lb+x1^cal:-64000:0:64000

  in those cases the default mapping for the unshifted axis should be used

* add analog emulation for button (i.e. the longer its pressed, the higher the value)

* write UIEvent::from_string()

* --four-way-restrictor for the dpad?

  - keep whatever direction is pressed first, don't allow walking over diagonals?
  - always keep last main direction until another main direction got pressed?
  - --disable-dpad-diagonals ur,dl,dl

* absolute mouse pointer can be created with:

  abs:1-ABS_X, abs:1-ABS_Y, key:1-BTN_LEFT

  document that somewhere, device must not contain REL_X, REL_Y or BTN_A or it won't work in X11  

* basic Dualstrike mouse emulation with absolute position:

 ./xboxdrv-dualstrike \
  --ui-clear \
  --ui-buttonmap rb=key:1-BTN_LEFT,lb=key:1-BTN_RIGHT \
  --ui-axismap x2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_X,y2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_Y \
  --ui-axismap x1=KEY_LEFT:KEY_RIGHT,y1=KEY_DOWN:KEY_UP  -s

* find a way to bring back --no-extra-devices, saves typing

* change default axis/button map depending on controller type (tricky as
  type is only really known after the axis/buttonmap as already been
  build):

* remove guide button from default mapping when its an Xbox1 controller

* guitar handling was changed in a4e1003cba0ff925358ce5ed84d2bf9a728e93d6 

* REL_ events could need acceleration support, as mouse emulation is currently kind of imprecise

* write example ini configs (as documented source for user customization):

  * default config

  * two joysticks with one stick
 
  * all buttons and axis shifted by LB and RB

  * evdev joystick to xbox360

  * dosbox flightstick emulation

  * high sensitivty

  * mouse emulation

* give some response curve examples:

  # Low sensitivity on the stick when LB is pressed:

 --ui-axismap lb+y1^resp:-8000:0:8000=ABS_Y,y1=ABS_Y,lb+x1^resp:-8000:0:8000=ABS_X,x1=ABS_X

* Not implementable as they need more then one axis: squareaxis, four-way-restrictor, dpad-rotation

* support for Playstation button names maybe? cross, triangle, circle, square, R3, L3, ...?


Stuff to do before 0.7.x release:
=================================

* "couldn't convert 'ABS_y' to enum, not a member of EV_ABS"
 
  convert all enum names to uppercase? or does that lead to conflicts in the naming?

* add extra checks to make sure the evdev buttons and axis given exist on the current device

* make dummy joystick axis creation optional

* --ui-axismap LT=KEY_A:KEY_B:1 

Here KEY_B is the key you want to send and KEY_A is a random other key
that you don't need. It's a hack as mapping both to KEY_B seems to
cause some trouble with automatic key repeat for some reason. Note
that you must not combine this with --trigger-as-zaxis as that will
disable LT and RT

* invert y axis on --evdev

* allow --type to work even when --device-by-id is not given

* axis emulation

  --ui-axisemulation A:B=ABS_X:5

* endpoints can be taken directly from the usb configuration, thus
  avoiding issues with nummeric endpoints

* bcdDevice (product release version) seem to indicate type (to many
  possible versions, not enough data):

new controller with merged endpoints: bcdDevice: 0x0114
old ones: 1.10

better way then to check for endpoints maybe

* 045e:028f is the play&charge kit, give an error message when somebody tries to use that

* match by protocol not, just vendor/product, from xpad.c:

/* Xbox 360 has a vendor-specific class, so we cannot match it with only
 * USB_INTERFACE_INFO (also specifically refused by USB subsystem), so we
 * match against vendor id as well. Wired Xbox 360 devices have protocol 1,
 * wireless controllers have protocol 129. */
#define XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR_PROTOCOL(vend,pr) \
        .match_flags = USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_VENDOR | USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_INT_INFO, \
        .idVendor = (vend), \
        .bInterfaceClass = USB_CLASS_VENDOR_SPEC, \
        .bInterfaceSubClass = 93, \
        .bInterfaceProtocol = (pr)
#define XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR(vend) \
        { XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR_PROTOCOL(vend,1) }, \
        { XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR_PROTOCOL(vend,129) }

* --ui-new must reset events to neutral when switching input mapping (done, but a hack)

* --ui-axismap doesn't work when same key name is given twice, either give warning or fix the issue:

  --ui-axismap LT=KEY_A:KEY_A:1

* in INI files allow:

  [xboxdrv]
  ui-buttonmap = A=BTN_A,B=BTN_B,...

Feature
=======

* figure out a way to make userspace force feedback driver not become dead processes

* better keyboard emulation via analog sticks: axis must not be
  handled separately as this leads to issues with the diagonals (see
  mail from Matthew G <matt@remort.org>) (maybe relative axis can help?)

* test TR:Anniversary with max effect 16

Stuff to do before 0.6.0 release:
=================================

* add Playstation3 controller config to examples, convert to ini (done)
  needs new config for bluetooth mode

 ./xboxdrv  \
  --evdev /dev/input/event6 \
  --evdev-absmap ABS_X=x1,ABS_Y=y1 \
  --evdev-absmap ABS_Z=x2,ABS_RZ=y2 \
  --evdev-absmap ABS_#48=lt,ABS_#49=rt \
  --evdev-keymap BTN_THUMB=tl,BTN_THUMB2=tr \
  --evdev-keymap BTN_BASE5=lb,BTN_BASE6=rb  \
  --evdev-keymap KEY_#302=a,KEY_#301=b,BTN_DEAD=x,KEY_#300=y \
  --evdev-keymap BTN_TRIGGER=back,KEY_#720=guide,BTN_TOP=start \
  --evdev-keymap BTN_TOP2=du,BTN_PINKIE=dr,BTN_BASE=dd,BTN_BASE2=dl


fixme:dinput:joy_polldev joystick cannot handle type 21 event (code 0) <- 21 == EV_FF (status report?) 

http://www.immersion.com/developer/downloads/ImmFundamentals/HTML/
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219655(VS.85).aspx

Later versions:
===============

* complex macro programming, i.e. complete evdev sequences, not just key combinations

* The World Tour wireless guitar have 5 buttons and a
  slide. Currently, the slide is mapped to the x axis, but I don't
  know if it allows multiple presses at once. I don't have a Xbox, so
  I don't know if it is allowed at all in the console.

Colour: 	Button: 	Value in X1 (slide):
Green 	A	-27500
Red	B	-12900
Yellow	Y	+7000
Blue	X	+18500
Orange	LB1	+32767
(None)	(None)	-300

* send FF status reports (maybe, is that used by anything?)

* figure out the max values of force feedback effects so that stuff is
  mapped more properly (kind of done, could need verification)

* figure out which devices xorg/hal handles as keyboard and how to
  make it always happen, seems to require two keyboard keys, devices
  with only one aren't registered

* report more precisly what devices got created, include device name (HAL has that information)

* add support for LED messages (can this be used by anything?)

* include id/wid in device name (would be cleaner, since it makes the
  device unique, but would make Xorg trouble worse)
