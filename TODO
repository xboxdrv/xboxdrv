Target for 0.8.3
================

* [BUG] force feedback seems to be on the wrong evdev device!

* --ff-device [auto|joystick|mouse|keyboard|NUM]

* fix get_ff_device() and default to JOYSTICK not 0

* include latest vendor/product id stuff (update NEWS accordingly)


Target for 0.9.?
================

* write a modifier that simulates latency

* use separate In/Out Ports for Modifier, never use InOut ports, make
  InOut ports a feature of the parser (i.e. two args -> InOut, four
  args -> 2 In, 2 Out)

* verify that all ButtonEvent and AxisEvent work, write test protocol for all

* document qmacro, Sector2ButtonModifier and analog-keyboard

* need support for blacklisting controllers so that they aren't picked up automatically (could recycle match rules)

* scan for BROKEN and "#if 0"

* do not use hardcoded default configuration, but read most stuff from
  examples/default.xboxdrv

* support arguments in exec via quoting:

  --ui-buttonmap du=exec:/usr/bin/script:Arg1:Arg2:Arg3
  --ui-buttonmap du=exec:/usr/bin/script:[Arg1:Arg2:Arg3]
  
  - what about more common quoting style:

  --ui-buttonmap du=exec:"/usr/bin/script":"Arg1":"Arg2":"Arg3"

    -> bad idea, as the " are eaten by bash, thus one would need double quots

  --ui-buttonmap 'du=exec:"/usr/bin/script":"Arg1":"Arg2":"Arg3"'

* print warning or something when people don't use rel with -1

* update Standards-Version in the Ubuntu packages

* XboxController rumble code is wrong, old usb stuff

* -r 128,128 --quit doesn't work:

[TEMP]  USBController::~USBController(): ~USBController
libusb:warning [libusb_close] internal signalling write failed, closing anyway

* chatpad doesn't get a 0x1b signal when its connected after xboxdrv
  is already running

* rumble-test is broken completely

* add "null" button and key event to disable a button or axis (useful
  to not triggering regular events when a shift button is pressed)

  - LB+A=do_something,LB+B=null

  - naming needs to be cleaned up: null (send nothing), void (clear
    the binding) would be confusing

== Documentation ==

* X11 will convert a REL_WHEEL value of 1 into a single click (press
  and release) of button 4, values of 3 would result in three clicks,
  etc. REL_HWEEL will be button 6 and 7, add that to documentation somewhere

== Bugs ==
     
* multiple ControllerThread lead to UInput::update() being called
  multiple times, as UInputMessageProcessor does call the update()
  which is wrong

* glib/D-Bus causes crash/exit when USBController::get_name() returns an invalid unicode string?!

Checklist
=========

* print which sub features are enabled: chatpad, force feedback, headset

* make dbus optional, make --no-dbus an alias for --dbus NONE or --dbus false (easier for config file)

* check force feedback

* check output when --silent not given

* check clean shutdown

* check valgrind

* check daemon

* check autofire and other modifier that depend on time

* test all controller

* check that the child process works

* check that uinput gets its timeout/update calls (send_rel_event)

* cleanup a lot of the log_trace() and other temporary debug output

* check that repeated wireless controller connects and disconnects work [done]

* check that --quit works, currently broken

* search for "#ifdef FIXME"

* do proper error checking: 

xboxdrv: src/usb_controller.cpp:218: void USBController::on_read_data(libusb_transfer*): Assertion `ret == LIBUSB_SUCCESS' failed.
Aborted

* exceptions in glib main loop might be dangerous and not really do what is intended

* move sigint/sigterm handling out of main.cpp and into xboxdrv_daemon.cpp (needs to use gmain_quit())

* LED do currently not get down on controller quit

* move LED setting into ControllerThread or somewhere else, not at controller creation time

* check that threads are cleaned up in daemon

* go through checklist, disable headset and chatpad support for now,
  do a source only release


Virtual Keyboard
================

* -d, --device DEVICE - the input device from which to read

* -b, --buttonmap KEY_A=key:KEY_Z maps input key KEY_A directly to output
   key KEY_Z, the graphical keyboard should show which of those bound
   keys are pressed, mainly useful for shift, ctrl, backspace and
   other frequently used keys

* -b, --buttonmap KEY_A=function:cursor_left,KEY_B=function:send_key
   button KEY_A to some internal function, such as advancing the
   cursor, sending the key currently under the cursor, etc.

* -a, --axismap
   ABS_X+=function:cursor_right,ABS_X-=function:cursor_left maps a
   half axis to an internal function, support for configurable
   auto-repeat on analog axis should be provided

* full input filter and modifier stack might be worth a consideration

* crazy stuff: allow both left and right analog sticks for cursor
  movement to allow double handed typing, sending would be done with
  the trigger


Target for 0.9.0
================

* add support for multiple Wiimotes

  -> can CWiid listen to multiple ones at once or does it need an Addr for that?

* cleanup all the assert("not implemented")/assert("implement me");

* set_axis_float(foo, 0) does not result in a 0 value due to two-complement

* cleanup axis, half-axis and rel events

  -> Linux doesn't handle half-axis special

  -> some filter might need to know if its a half axis or not

  -> CompressHalfAxisFilter?

* allow something like [done, test it some more]:

  void=BTN_A

  to create empty events on uinput

  - boost::tokenizer() with an empty input string produces no tokens,
    not a single token with an empty string

  - see: CommandLineParser::set_ui_buttonmap(ButtonMap& btn_map, const std::string& name, const std::string& value)

  - need ButtonCombination::void() or something like that, just
    ButtonCombination() probably already does the right thing, except
    for the btn_map.lookup() thing

    ButtonCombination::from_string("void") -> ButtonCombination() could be the solution

* implement AxisEvent::send_clear()

* rewrite AxisMap to support unlimited number of shift key

* implement ButtonEventPtr ButtonMap::lookup(const ButtonCombination& buttons) const;



* check if key_copy_modifier is needed or if it could be done with
  axismap/buttonmap

* add --clear-buttonmap, --clear-axismap

* make --led X part of the --config, that would allow free LED switching

* add battery status as axis output

* wireless controller LED should be reset on connect

* "--ui-buttonmap=void" style button events are broken

* Playstation3 Controller ignores its analog data and doesn't record it into ControllerMsg

* don't bother with virtualkeyboard, just make it basically functional, not polished

* cleanup event output, add ControllerMessageDescription or something like that

* check that Playstation3 controller works with new ControllerMessage

* mouse emulation is broken?! axis are inverted

* update/fix man-page: document

  -> rewrite the --ui-axismap, --ui-buttonmap section, currently kind
     of confusing and overlapping with Input Event section

* test if its possible to mix cycle-key with macro: or other advanced
  ButtonEvents

* "--dbus system" currently does not work as expected

$ sudo ./xboxdrv --daemon  --dbus system --quiet
[ERROR] XboxdrvDaemon::run(): fatal exception: failed to get unique dbus name: Connection ":1.55" is not allowed to own the service "org.seul.Xboxdrv" due to security policies in the configuration file
libusb:warning [libusb_close] internal signalling write failed, closing anyway
libusb:warning [libusb_close] internal signalling write failed, closing anyway
libusb:warning [libusb_close] internal signalling write failed, closing anyway
libusb:warning [libusb_close] internal signalling write failed, closing anyway

 -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4560877/dbus-bus-request-name-connections-are-not-allowed-to-own-the-service

* update/fix man-page

  -> rewrite the --ui-axismap, --ui-buttonmap section, currently kind
     of confusing

  -> add --dbus documentation

* cycle-key is incomplete, should have additional mode that allows
  next/prev without sending events, also has issues with stuck buttons
  when multiple keys are pressed

  -> only one key should be allowed to be pressed, last one will always be released (still fishy)
  -> separate last and curr key to allow toggle without press
  -> have each ButtonEvent be responsible to release the keys it
     pressed? -> tricky, as it doesn't know those right now

  -> need a time delay before button is actually send for situations
     where sending the key is expensive (weapon switching in game might be slow)

  -> add an option to have the cycle sequence not wrap around: 
     -> possible use: throttle in a flightsim mapped to 1-9

  Possible future improvements:

  - next/prev button that don't trigger the key, an activate button or
    activate by timeout (to work around slow weapon change in some
    games)

  - graphical overlay that displays the current position
    -> requires separate process

  - single button inventory: next, hold to activate

* d-bus requires X11?! -> try system bus when running as root


Target for 0.?.?
================

* RelButtonEventHandler: add DELAY:REPEAT (like keyboard keys) instead
  of just REPEAT (or not? should be doable with autofire filter)

* alternative inventory solution: use the dpad, which gives however
  only eight directions, need some timeout thing to make the
  directions sticky

  - modifier that separates the dpad into eight buttons

  - hold button to make it 'sticky' (maybe a delay filter to allow two
    level hold buttons, one to not confuse diagonals with vert/horz
    movement, another regular hold buttos)  

* MacroButtonEventHandler is still using raw UInput::send(), should
  use UIEventEmitterPtr instead

- UInput::send_rel_repetitive() should be removed or refactored into
  its own class

* develop a simple scripting language or use an existing one

  - script gets message object and last message object as input,
    provides modified message object as output

* look at suspend handling

* pass /dev/input/eventX, slot and serial number to on-connect script

  - write a class to guess which event devices will be created given a
    configuration

* write DummyController that can be used in automated test cases

* allow the creation of virtual mice and keyboards with all buttons
  and rel events, to allow realtime reconfiguration

  - --all-key-events, --add-rel-events, --add-abs-events (might cause
      trouble with type auto detection, thus limiting to only mouse-,
      joystick- and keyboard-events might be needed instead of
      separating by REL, ABS and KEY alone

  - call should be just a shortcut for --ui-buttonmap void=BTN_A,void=BTN_B,...

* native REL events

* get rid of UIEvent::resolve_device_id() if possible

* implement filter that removes glitched button events, i.e. events
  that happen in very low timespans and are caused by broken micro switches

* use FIXME for random code improvements, use BUG for actual problems

* Collect Linux games with force feedback support: Bzflag?

* provide more meaningful debug output for force feedback

* cleanup UIEvent

* --chatpad-debug is broken, use it for all the log_tmp()

* there is a long delay in processing rumble messages, currently
  worked around by only sending rumble commands on changes, but that
  isn't a full solution, proper solution would be discarding messages
  and only sending the current value

* active wireless controller aren't detected on startup of the daemon,
  only they have send an event, any way to get activity status of the thing?

* print which sub features are enabled: chatpad, force feedback, headset

* check force feedback

* rumble-test is broken completely

* check output when --silent not given

* check clean shutdown

* check valgrind

* check daemon

* check autofire and other modifier that depend on time

* test all controller

* check that the child process works

* check that uinput gets its timeout/update calls (send_rel_event)

* cleanup a lot of the log_trace() and other temporary debug output

* check that repeated wireless controller connects and disconnects work [done]

* check that --quit works, currently broken

* search for "#ifdef FIXME"

* do proper error checking: 

xboxdrv: src/usb_controller.cpp:218: void USBController::on_read_data(libusb_transfer*): Assertion `ret == LIBUSB_SUCCESS' failed.
Aborted

* exceptions in glib main loop might be dangerous and not really do what is intended

* move sigint/sigterm handling out of main.cpp and into xboxdrv_daemon.cpp (needs to use gmain_quit())

* LED do currently not get down on controller quit

* move LED setting into ControllerThread or somewhere else, not at controller creation time

* check that threads are cleaned up in daemon

* go through checklist, disable headset and chatpad support for now,
  do a source only release

Stuff to do before 0.8.x release:
=================================

* add LD_PRELOAD joystick override hack to running xboxdrv with an app.exe

* change response curve syntax to allow defining two values for the
  same point, one for the left one for the right to allow hard jumps
  or allow giving x,y coordinates to have points net evenly spaced out, maybe both

* add expression modifier:

  --modifier X1^expr=V*6+1<<2

* old udev errors:

g++ -o src/xboxdrv_daemon.o -c -isystem/usr/include/dbus-1.0 -isystem/
usr/lib/dbus-1.0/include -isystem/usr/include/glib-2.0 -isystem/usr/
lib/glib-2.0/include -pthread -isystem/usr/local/include/libusb-1.0 -g
-O3 -Wall -ansi -pedantic -DPACKAGE_VERSION='"0.7.3"' -Isrc src/
xboxdrv_daemon.cpp
src/xboxdrv_daemon.cpp: In member function 'void
XboxdrvDaemon::init_udev_monitor(const Options&)':
src/xboxdrv_daemon.cpp:251: error:
'udev_monitor_filter_add_match_subsystem_devtype' was not declared in
this scope
scons: *** [src/xboxdrv_daemon.o] Error 1
scons: building terminated because of errors.
make: *** [xboxdrv] Error 2

* macro support needs to search files in a few more locations;

  * current directory
  * directory of parent .ini file
  * users xboxdrv config directory (don't have that yet)

* macro supports needs "init" command (somewhat done)

* add support for "include" in macro

* add support for macros that always reload when evaluated (makes testing easier)

* document REL_ -1 better

* when verbose is given, warn when keys are dual mapped, give list of free keys

* space is currently illegal, but shouldn't be "GUIDE = KEY_LEFTALT + KEY_E" 

* extra-devices adds a button when one only uses JS_0 buttons, shouldn't happen

  -> or maybe it should, as not only the kernel matters, but also SDL

* invert y axis on --evdev

* add double-click button, in the same way as hold-button

* add --controller 4 or --controller-count 4 or something like that

* add special LED status set switches the LED with the given config

* export build-in config files, both as text and as directory, so that users can browse them

* deadzone:MIN:MAX:SMOOTH is broken (fixed)

* deadzone filter documentation is wrong

Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed." failed to open connection to bus: /bin/dbus-launch terminated abnormally with the following error: Autolaunch error: X11 initialization failed.

* add named output variables to chain filters and modifiers?!

== Daemon ==

* check how daemon reacts on suspend
  - suspending the computer leads to LIBUSB_ERROR_IO, unplugging the
    controller leads to LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER
    -> couldn't be replicated, both give LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER
  - errno is set to EBUSY
  - the device handle can't be reused, device has to be reallocated
  - integrate this with the "keep backlog of devices currently in use"

* do something with stdout/stderr when its run in --detach mode

== Other ==

* add a way to refresh/reshuffle controller asignment with xboxdrvctrl
  (i.e. having two controller and unplugging the first won't reassign
  the second to the first slot, that should be available on request)

* button presses are lost even with "--priority realtime" for the wireless controller

  -> xboxdrv isn't running under realtime priority, only its subthreads, fix that
  -> figure out how USBReadThread reacts to the device being closed
     -> USBReadThread doesn't react at all, it becomes stuck in the last call

* use static X11 keysym map to do the string translation?

* split src/axis_event.hpp and src/button_event.hpp

* mouse emulation is very jaggy (try painting in Gimp), caused by
  REL_X and REL_Y being send independently, while they should be
  synced up, this is a side-effect of the deadzone, without deadzone,
  no jaggies

  -> UInput::send_rel_repetitive() needs to syncronize all REL events
     with the same repeat interval whenever a new event comes in

     send_val = value * time_count / repeat;
     time_count = 0;

  -> add a repeat timeout 0  that sends on each update

  -> should be use special value '-1' or repurpose '0'?

  -> do we need more rel types? rel-once? or can repeat values be
     abused?
     
     repeat: 0 - always repeat, -1, never repeat, NUM - repeat every NUM msec

  -> add rel-repeat:{repeat} type that repeats more often the more the
     stick is pressed, to give better scroll wheel emulation

* add "key-repeat", similar to rel-repeat

* add "key-once" or something like that, that only clicks a key
  without keeping it pressed

* documentation needs to be improved

* --ui-axismap LT=KEY_A:KEY_B:1 

Here KEY_B is the key you want to send and KEY_A is a random other key
that you don't need. It's a hack as mapping both to KEY_B seems to
cause some trouble with automatic key repeat for some reason. Note
that you must not combine this with --trigger-as-zaxis as that will
disable LT and RT -> already fixed, check it

* add a "click" filter or something like that, that causes a button to only be clicked, not hold

* LED isn't set proper when wireless controllers wake up from power-down


== Unsolved/WontFix ==

* after every thread cleanup, do an enumeration over all USB devices,
  find those not currently used by a Slot and recreate them, this
  should fix resume issues, this would also fix the issue with
  ignoring controllers when all slots are full

  -> bad idea, as it would let unused controllers slip into the free
     slots, could lead to unexpected behaviour

  -> maybe as D-Bus interface?

* allow multiple controllers in non-daemon mode
  -> not a good idea, complicates stuff and duplicates code
  -> make daemon mode the default in the future and make it as solid
     as non-daemon mode

* remember controllers that couldn't be used when all slots where full
  and use them when a slot got free -> discard, bad idea, as it
  results in confusing behaviour

* daemon and regular xboxdrv have different controller orderings 

  -> hard to avoid, as wireless controllers are only picked up when
     active, which they always become later then the wired ones, which
     are active by default)

* BTN_A@joystick.1 doesn't work for a single joystick, why? (joystick isn't id=0, why?)

  - should there be a '@default'? should @joystick be the default?

* improve output on which uinput devices are created (even with udev
  there doesn't seem to be a bullet proof way to detect what gets
  created)

  -> insert "guess code" before the uinput create call and just pretent thats bullet proof
  -> figure out how exactly device names are choosen (first free or
     are there other means? need to take special axes/buttons into account)

== Daemon ==

* improve output in daemon mode, when --quiet is not given print the
  number of allocated controller slots

* get rid of all std::cout stuff when using detached daemon, redirect
  log output to a file, syslog or somewhere else: 

  --silent:  stops event output
  --quiet:   stops all stdout output (automatically used when --detach is given, except for errors)
  --verbose: print info level log output
  --debug:   print debug level log output


== D-Bus ==

* interface for next release:

  Daemon/GetControllerSlotCount -> INT // do we need those or can
  Daemon/GetControllerCount -> INT     // directories be browsed?

== Other ==

* document that Xbox360 wireless controller shuts down at 15min

* give proper exit code when no controller is found

* sort options a bit more between global ones, slot local ones and
  config local ones

* in INI files should allow:

  [xboxdrv]
  ui-buttonmap = A=BTN_A,B=BTN_B,...

  - in general cleanup config handling, turn almost everything into
    proper functions and use the same functions for both cmdline and ini

* allow setting a --default-name from which all other controller names
  are derived 
   -> already there in the form of auto.auto? 
     -> No, as those don't derive the name, but set a fixed one

* allow swap/assign of controller to slots via dbus

* do modifier/filter dump when --verbose is given, make verbose
  overall more useful

* make more use of percentance values (in deadzone filter for example)

* couldn't convert 'XK_Page_Up' to enum, not a member of X11Keysym
  currenty code can't handle multple names for a single key

* add a fun modifier that counts button presses and other useless stuff

  - count button presses (done)
  - count time a button is held down, both in min:sec and percent
  - count distance an axis travels
  - allow access/reset via dbus

  * document them, ignore axis and button time for now

* look at Joy2key for better mouse support (mouse acceleration), see Dustin Moline mails
  * timeout makes a huge difference, real MarbleMouse Trackball send around every 10msec
  * need to deal with rounding errors to allow small movements

* add --ui-buttonmap A=KEY_A:KEY_B:1000:1 

  the last 0/1 parameter tells if it should do:

   - 0: send on release
   - 1: always send when pressed

  different games might require different behaviours for the
  hold-button, so it should be an user option

* add double shift buttons: L+R+start

* add execv: that takes arguments in ARG0:ARG1,... style

* add system: that takes arguments "ARG0 ARG1 ..." style

* add [controller0/config0] support for ControllerOptions

* add [controller0] support for ControllerSlotOptions

* write relaxation modifier/filter

* make extra-event creation a bit more clever, i.e. only create BTN_A
  when needed, not when another button is present that can be used to
  identify the device as joystick, also document exactly which
  buttons/axis combinations are valid.

Other Stuff
===========

* remove uinput.send_rel_repetitive() replace with just EventHandler::update()

  -> might not be needed, send_rel_repetitive() is kind of convenient  

  -> send_rel_repetitive() doesn't work with multi-axis REL events (mouse emulation)

* boost::lexical_cast<> error messages are useless, make some better ones

Daemon Match Rules
==================

* add match rule for wireless id -> not really useful as that id is
  more or less random

* add --exclude, --exclude-group as ControllerMatchRules

* XboxdrvThread or XboxGenericController must hold information on
  their: bus:dev, vendor:product and other potentially useful
  information, match rule must match against controller, not
  udev_device
   -> doesn't work, as we don't have a controller at that point
   -> match against abstract ControllerInfo object?
   -> get_busnum()
   -> get_devnum()

   -> figure out potential matches early and save the valid slots?
      -> ugly but could work

* --match again sysname could make sense, seems somewhat constant:
  "5-2" Xbox1 controller results in "5-2.1", due to being really two
  devices, would help to now how exactly those are formed

* extend usbid match rule to bcd device


Stuff to do before 0.7.3 release:
=================================

* turn EnumBox into singleton

* allow EnumBox to have multiple names per values per key

* allow --modifier help, --ui-buttonmap X2^help

* move XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN behind XBOX_BTN_MAX (or make it -1), so
  iteration can start from 0 instead of 1, also fix incorrect
  iterations all over the place -> doesn't work as some code uses
  XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN as 'no button is pressed'

* document significant patches in AUTHORS

      2     Added latest version of runxboxdrv from Michael Rans <rans@email.com>
      1     Added trigger deadzone patch from Jan Henning Thorsen <git@flodhest.net> with a few changes

      1     Implemented --ui-buttonmap A=BTN_A@{device_id} ??!?!?

* need to hide/disable the toggle button from the UIButtonmap
  - maybe implement some full post-parsing option verification to
    check for conflicts and necessary modifications?
  - Options::finish() to do final things?


* add Wiimote and PS3 bluetooth support 

* -R, --rumble-test is broken for FirestormDualController (has no analog triggers)

* add ABS support to macros events (need to deal with min/max)

* add support for pairing the controller to the PC (or zero)

* get rid of set_button()/get_button(), turn the message objects into full classes

* make chatpad configurable:

  --ui-chatpad a=KEY_A,green+a=SHIFT_X+KEY_B,...

* make sure that XK_??? names work with keys that are
  shifted/mode_switched in the keymap, i.e. send key combination

* can't parse:

 --ui-axismap x2=2-ABS_X,y2=2-ABS_Y

  only this works:

 --ui-axismap x2=abs:2-ABS_X,y2=abs:2-ABS_Y

  implement better guessing

* current deadzone code messes up the diagonals

* shifted axis without default mapping don't work:

  ./xboxdrv --ui-axismap lb+x1^cal:-64000:0:64000

  in those cases the default mapping for the unshifted axis should be used

* add analog emulation for button (i.e. the longer its pressed, the higher the value)

* write UIEvent::from_string()

* basic Dualstrike mouse emulation with absolute position:

 ./xboxdrv-dualstrike \
  --ui-clear \
  --ui-buttonmap rb=key:1-BTN_LEFT,lb=key:1-BTN_RIGHT \
  --ui-axismap x2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_X,y2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_Y \
  --ui-axismap x1=KEY_LEFT:KEY_RIGHT,y1=KEY_DOWN:KEY_UP  -s

* change default axis/button map depending on controller type (tricky as
  type is only really known after the axis/buttonmap as already been
  build):

* remove guide button from default mapping when its an Xbox1 controller

* guitar handling was changed in a4e1003cba0ff925358ce5ed84d2bf9a728e93d6 

* REL_ events could need acceleration support, as mouse emulation is currently kind of imprecise

* add extra checks to make sure the evdev buttons and axis given exist
  on the current device when using --evdev

* allow --type to work even when --device-by-id is not given

* axis emulation

  --ui-axisemulation A:B=ABS_X:5

* match by protocol not, just vendor/product, from xpad.c:

/* Xbox 360 has a vendor-specific class, so we cannot match it with only
 * USB_INTERFACE_INFO (also specifically refused by USB subsystem), so we
 * match against vendor id as well. Wired Xbox 360 devices have protocol 1,
 * wireless controllers have protocol 129. */

Feature
=======

* figure out a way to make userspace force feedback driver not become dead processes

* test TR:Anniversary with max effect 16

Later versions:
===============

* The World Tour wireless guitar have 5 buttons and a
  slide. Currently, the slide is mapped to the x axis, but I don't
  know if it allows multiple presses at once. I don't have a Xbox, so
  I don't know if it is allowed at all in the console.

Colour: 	Button: 	Value in X1 (slide):
Green 	A	-27500
Red	B	-12900
Yellow	Y	+7000
Blue	X	+18500
Orange	LB1	+32767
(None)	(None)	-300

* send FF status reports (maybe, is that used by anything?)

* figure out the max values of force feedback effects so that stuff is
  mapped more properly (kind of done, could need verification)

* figure out which devices xorg/hal handles as keyboard and how to
  make it always happen, seems to require two keyboard keys, devices
  with only one aren't registered

* report more precisly what devices got created, include device name (HAL has that information)

* add support for LED messages (can this be used by anything?)


Stuff to do before 0.8.0 release:
=================================

* Playstation 3 controller bluetooth support
  - http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixlinux.en.html
  - http://www.motioninjoy.com/

  - figure out what the remaining unknown bits mean:

     data from just pluging the controller in and out a few times
     without much pause inbetween:

- cleanup evtest some more, add more features
- using rumble in scripts doesn't work, since you can't reset rumble back to 0,0
- thread away on all endpoints
- read from stdin on the main thread
- send output to file or so
