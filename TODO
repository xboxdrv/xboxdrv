Pre Release Testing:
====================

* check the version number

VERSION="$(cat VERSION)"
TAG="v${VERSION}"
git tag -s  "${TAG}" -m "xboxdrv ${TAG}" 

# Normal Source
git archive --format=tar --prefix="xboxdrv-linux-${VERSION}/" ${TAG} | bzip2 -c > /tmp/xboxdrv-linux-${VERSION}.tar.bz2

git push --tags


Ubuntu Package:
===============

add libudev, libusb-1.0 to builddependencies

# Ubuntu 10.10

$ cd ../debian/
$ git checkout master
$ git-import-orig -u 0.7.1 ~/projects/xboxdrv/htdocs/xboxdrv-linux-0.7.1.tar.bz2 
$ dch -v "0.7.1-1" "xboxdrv 0.7.1 release"
$ git-buildpackage --git-no-create-orig --git-tag --git-builder="debuild -S"
$ sudo pbuilder --build ../xboxdrv_0.7.1-1.dsc
$ dput my-ppa ../xboxdrv_0.7.1-1_source.changes

# Ubuntu 10.04 (LTS)

$ cd ../debian/
$ git checkout master-lts
$ git merge master
$ dch -b -v "0.7.1-1~lucid1" --distribution lucid "xboxdrv 0.7.1 backport"
$ git-buildpackage --git-no-create-orig --git-debian-branch=master-lts --git-tag --git-builder="debuild -S"
$ sudo pbuilder --build ../xboxdrv_0.7.1-1~lucid1.dsc
$ dput my-ppa ../xboxdrv_0.7.1-1~lucid1_source.changes


Stuff to do before 0.7.1 release:
=================================

* add [controller0/config0] support for ControllerOptions

* add [controller0] support for ControllerSlotOptions

Documentation
=============

* update debian package description

* copy examples to documentation dir in the Ubuntu packages

* write example ini configs (as documented source for user customization):

  * default config

  * two joysticks with one stick
 
  * all buttons and axis shifted by LB and RB

  * evdev joystick to xbox360

  * dosbox flightstick emulation

  * high sensitivty

  * mouse emulation

* give some response curve examples:

  # Low sensitivity on the stick when LB is pressed:

 --ui-axismap lb+y1^resp:-8000:0:8000=ABS_Y,y1=ABS_Y,lb+x1^resp:-8000:0:8000=ABS_X,x1=ABS_X


Stuff to do before 0.7.2 release:
=================================

* write relaxation modifier/filter

Daemon
======

* improve output in daemon mode, when --quiet is not given print the
  number of allocated controller slots

* how exactly does daemon interact with wireless pads?! allow --wid --id for daemon

Other Stuff
===========

* in INI files allow:

  [xboxdrv]
  ui-buttonmap = A=BTN_A,B=BTN_B,...

  - in general cleanup config handling, turn almost everything into
    proper functions and use the same functions for both cmdline and ini

* --ui-axismap LT=KEY_A:KEY_B:1 

Here KEY_B is the key you want to send and KEY_A is a random other key
that you don't need. It's a hack as mapping both to KEY_B seems to
cause some trouble with automatic key repeat for some reason. Note
that you must not combine this with --trigger-as-zaxis as that will
disable LT and RT

* check how daemon reacts on suspend
  - suspending the computer leads to LIBUSB_ERROR_IO, unplugging the
    controller leads to LIBUSB_ERROR_OTHER

* remember controllers that couldn't be used when all slots where full
  and use them when a slot got free

* improve output on which uinput devices are created (even with udev
  there doesn't seem to be a bullet proof way to detect what gets
  created)

* do modifier/filter dump when --verbose is given, make verbose
  overall more useful

* remove uinput.send_rel_repetitive() replace with just EventHandler::update()

* add --device-usbid TYPE.SLOT=VENDOR:PRODUCT:VERSION

* allow multiple controllers in non-daemon mode

* make more use of percentance values (in deadzone filter for example)

* add extra arguments to --on-connect and --on-disconnect (controller name, usb path, etc.)

* boost::lexical_cast<> error messages are useless, make some better ones

* couldn't convert 'XK_Page_Up' to enum, not a member of X11Keysym
  currenty code can't handle multple names for a single key

* --match again sysname could make sense, seems somewhat constant:
  "5-2" Xbox1 controller results in "5-2.1", due to being really two
  devices, would help to now how exactly those are formed

* --four-way-restrictor for the dpad?

  - keep whatever direction is pressed first, don't allow walking over diagonals?
  - always keep last main direction until another main direction got pressed?
  - --disable-dpad-diagonals ur,dl,dl

  * extend usbid match rule to bcd device

* get rid of all std::cout stuff when using detached daemon, redirect
  log output to a file somewhere else: 

  --silent:  stops event output
  --quiet:   stops all stdout output (automatically used when --detach is given)
  --verbose: print info level log output
  --debug:   print debug level log output


Stuff to do before 0.7.3 release:
=================================

* turn EnumBox into singleton

* allow EnumBox to have multiple names per values per key

* allow --modifier help, --ui-buttonmap X2^help

* move XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN behind XBOX_BTN_MAX (or make it -1), so
  iteration can start from 0 instead of 1, also fix incorrect
  iterations all over the place -> doesn't work as some code uses
  XBOX_BTN_UNKNOWN as 'no button is pressed'

* document significant patches in AUTHORS

      2     Added latest version of runxboxdrv from Michael Rans <rans@email.com>
      1     Added trigger deadzone patch from Jan Henning Thorsen <git@flodhest.net> with a few changes
      1     Applied daniel åkerud <daniel.akerud@gmail.com>'s SIGTERM patch
      1     Applied low latency patch from daniel åkerud <daniel.akerud@gmail.com>
      1 Author: Aaron Denney <wnoise@ofb.net>
      1     hal daemon from Thomas Debouverie <debouverie_thomas@yahoo.fr>
      1     Implemented --ui-buttonmap A=BTN_A@{device_id} ??!?!?

* need to hide/disable the toggle button from the UIButtonmap
  - maybe implement some full post-parsing option verification to
    check for conflicts and necessary modifications?
  - Options::finish() to do final things?


Stuff to do before 0.7.x release:
=================================

* add Wiimote and PS3 bluetooth support 

* -R, --rumble-test is broken for FirestormDualController (has no analog triggers)

* add ABS support to macros events (need to deal with min/max)

* Playstation 3 controller support
  - http://www.pabr.org/sixlinux/sixlinux.en.html
  - http://www.motioninjoy.com/

  - figure out what the remaining unknown bits mean:

     data from just pluging the controller in and out a few times
     without much pause inbetween:

     Dualshock3:
     // leaving controller plugged in for a longer time settles to this:

     00 00 02 ee 10 00 00 00 00 02 b2 77 01 81
     
     random guesses: bluetooth id, serial number, calibration data,
     battery status

* add support for pairing the controller to the PC (or zero)

  --ps3-pair 00:00:00:00:00:00
  --ps3-pair-with-bluetooth

* get rid of set_button()/get_button(), turn the message objects into full classes

* make chatpad configurable:

  --ui-chatpad a=KEY_A,green+a=SHIFT_X+KEY_B,...

* make sure that XK_??? names work with keys that are
  shifted/mode_switched in the keymap, i.e. send key combination

* can't parse:

 --ui-axismap x2=2-ABS_X,y2=2-ABS_Y

  only this works:

 --ui-axismap x2=abs:2-ABS_X,y2=abs:2-ABS_Y

  implement better guessing

* current deadzone code messes up the diagonals

* shifted axis without default mapping don't work:

  ./xboxdrv --ui-axismap lb+x1^cal:-64000:0:64000

  in those cases the default mapping for the unshifted axis should be used

* add analog emulation for button (i.e. the longer its pressed, the higher the value)

* write UIEvent::from_string()

* basic Dualstrike mouse emulation with absolute position:

 ./xboxdrv-dualstrike \
  --ui-clear \
  --ui-buttonmap rb=key:1-BTN_LEFT,lb=key:1-BTN_RIGHT \
  --ui-axismap x2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_X,y2^cal:-25000:0:25000=abs:1-ABS_Y \
  --ui-axismap x1=KEY_LEFT:KEY_RIGHT,y1=KEY_DOWN:KEY_UP  -s

Chatpad

* change default axis/button map depending on controller type (tricky as
  type is only really known after the axis/buttonmap as already been
  build):

* remove guide button from default mapping when its an Xbox1 controller

* guitar handling was changed in a4e1003cba0ff925358ce5ed84d2bf9a728e93d6 

* REL_ events could need acceleration support, as mouse emulation is currently kind of imprecise

Stuff to do before 0.7.x release:
=================================

* add extra checks to make sure the evdev buttons and axis given exist on the current device

* invert y axis on --evdev

* allow --type to work even when --device-by-id is not given

* axis emulation

  --ui-axisemulation A:B=ABS_X:5

* match by protocol not, just vendor/product, from xpad.c:

/* Xbox 360 has a vendor-specific class, so we cannot match it with only
 * USB_INTERFACE_INFO (also specifically refused by USB subsystem), so we
 * match against vendor id as well. Wired Xbox 360 devices have protocol 1,
 * wireless controllers have protocol 129. */
#define XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR_PROTOCOL(vend,pr) \
        .match_flags = USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_VENDOR | USB_DEVICE_ID_MATCH_INT_INFO, \
        .idVendor = (vend), \
        .bInterfaceClass = USB_CLASS_VENDOR_SPEC, \
        .bInterfaceSubClass = 93, \
        .bInterfaceProtocol = (pr)
#define XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR(vend) \
        { XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR_PROTOCOL(vend,1) }, \
        { XPAD_XBOX360_VENDOR_PROTOCOL(vend,129) }

  --ui-axismap LT=KEY_A:KEY_A:1

Feature
=======

* figure out a way to make userspace force feedback driver not become dead processes

* test TR:Anniversary with max effect 16


fixme:dinput:joy_polldev joystick cannot handle type 21 event (code 0) <- 21 == EV_FF (status report?) 

http://www.immersion.com/developer/downloads/ImmFundamentals/HTML/
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb219655(VS.85).aspx

Later versions:
===============

* The World Tour wireless guitar have 5 buttons and a
  slide. Currently, the slide is mapped to the x axis, but I don't
  know if it allows multiple presses at once. I don't have a Xbox, so
  I don't know if it is allowed at all in the console.

Colour: 	Button: 	Value in X1 (slide):
Green 	A	-27500
Red	B	-12900
Yellow	Y	+7000
Blue	X	+18500
Orange	LB1	+32767
(None)	(None)	-300

* send FF status reports (maybe, is that used by anything?)

* figure out the max values of force feedback effects so that stuff is
  mapped more properly (kind of done, could need verification)

* figure out which devices xorg/hal handles as keyboard and how to
  make it always happen, seems to require two keyboard keys, devices
  with only one aren't registered

* report more precisly what devices got created, include device name (HAL has that information)

* add support for LED messages (can this be used by anything?)

* include id/wid in device name (would be cleaner, since it makes the
  device unique, but would make Xorg trouble worse)
