[[ Xbox/Xbox360 USB Gamepad Driver for Userspace ]]
===================================================

Xboxdrv is a Xbox/Xbox360 gamepad driver for Linux that works in
userspace. It is an alternative to the xpad kernel driver and has
support for Xbox1 gamepads, Xbox360 USB gamepads and Xbox360 wireless
gamepads. The Xbox360 guitar and some Xbox1 dancemats might work too.
The Xbox 360 racing wheel is not supported, but shouldn't be to hard
to add if somebody is interested.
Controllers for the Xbox One (third generation console) are not
supported.

Some basic support for the Xbox360 Chatpad on USB controller is
provided, Chatpad on wireless ones is not supported. The headset is
not supported, but you can dump raw data from it.

This driver is only of interest if the xpad kernel driver doesn't work
for you or if you want more configurabity. If the xpad kernel driver
works for you there is no need to try this driver.

Newest version of the driver can be found at:

 * http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/

The development version can be optained via:

 * git clone http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv.git


[[ Compilation ]]
-----------------

Required libraries and tools:

 * g++ - GNU C++ Compiler
 * libusb-1.0
 * pkg-config
 * libudev
 * boost
 * scons
 * uinput (userspace input kernel module)
 * git (only to download the development version)
 * X11
 * libdbus
 * glib
 * Gtk+ (optional, for VirtualKeyboard)
 * CWiid (optional, for Wiimote support)

Once everything installed, you can compile by typing:

 $ scons

On Ubuntu 11.04 you can install all the required libraries via:

 $ sudo apt-get install \
     g++ \
     libboost1.42-dev \
     scons \
     pkg-config \
     libusb-1.0-0-dev \
     git-core \
     libx11-dev \
     libudev-dev \
     x11proto-core-dev \
     libdbus-glib-1-dev \
     libgtk2.0-dev \
     libcwiid-dev

To load the uinput kernel module automatically on boot add it
/etc/modules, to load it manually type:

 $ sudo modprobe uinput

On other distributions exact install instructions might be
slightly different.


[[ Installation ]]
------------------

Once the compilation process is complete you can install xboxdrv with:

 $ make install

You can also change the install PREFIX and DESTDIR as usual with:

 $ make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=/tmp

Note that there is no need to install xboxdrv, you can run it directly
from the source directory if you prefer.


[[ Running ]]
-------------

Extensive documentation on running xboxdrv can be found in the RUNNING
XBOXDRV section of the xboxdrv manpage. When you haven't installed
xboxdrv the man page can be found in doc/xboxdrv.1 and be read with:
